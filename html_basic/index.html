  <h1>Welcome to My Cool First Webpage</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is my very first webpage as part of my HTML learning journey. It's built using basic HTML tags.</p>

  <h3>Why I'm Learning HTML</h3>
  <p>I want to become a great web developer, and learning the fundamentals is the first step.</p>

  <p>HTML allows you to create the structure of webpages, and it’s surprisingly simple to start with.</p>

  <p>Enrolled in ALX frontend development program, which is for 16 weeks.</p>
